# Photonic Systems Research Group

Welcome to the **Photonic Systems Research Group** at Michigan State University! Contributions needed and very welcome! Majority of needed contributions are text on the website and does not need much technical knowledge. Currently, majority of text I'm using is generative AI placeholders that make some sense and give some direction but are not worthy of publication.

- Link to running webpage hosted on my personal github pages can be found here <https://muhnyx.github.io/PSRG_website/>. We intend to ask DECS to host on MSU's official site.

> **This repository and website are a work in progress.**  
> Content, code, and documentation are actively being updated.
