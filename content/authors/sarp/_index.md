I am an undergraduate student in Electrical Engineering at Michigan State University and an undergraduate research assistant in the Photonic Systems Research Group (PSRG), advised by Dr. Thomas Clark. My current work focuses on hands-on experimentation in ultrafast optics, where I am building an autocorrelator for femtosecond pulse characterization, using two-photon absorption and second-harmonic generation as non-linear detection methods. Looking ahead, I plan to explore more advanced areas of photonics, as I continue developing both my experimental and theoretical skills in the field.

Across various club involvements, courses, and projects, my technical background spans analog and digital signal processing, PCB design, ultrasonic sensing, Verilog based digital system design, and hardware-software interfacing for communication and control, including FPGA and microcontroller-based system design. At Michigan State University, I developed a real-time closed loop cloud architecture for the operation and control of aggregated distributed energy resources (DERs) and other power systems, submitting a paper as first author. I have prior experience working at Turkish Aerospace Industries where I supported ground test operations and assisted in resolving avionics issues for Turkeyâ€™s fifth generation fighter jet as well as contributing to flight control system simulations. Additionally, I gained experience in cybersecurity during my internship at Palo Alto Networks working on various projects involving firewall setup, traffic analysis, and automation. In particular my experience in aerospace systems sparked a broader interest that I am eager to explore further alongside my future work in photonic systems.
