I’m a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Michigan State University, working under the guidance of Prof. Thomas Clark. My current research focuses on photonics, particularly the characterization of low-noise, ultrafast lasers and the development of photonic integrated circuits. We're building next-generation, reconfigurable systems with real-world impact in communications, quantum technologies, and high performance computing.

Ignited by a childhood wonder for the birth and structure of stars, my initial academic journey involved seeking out the fundamental laws of nature that shape the elegant macrostructures of stars and galaxies. This curiosity led me to pursuing a master’s in physics, using rigorous coursework and computational projects to model astrophysical phenomena like galaxy formation and asteroid dynamics. Over time, my focus evolved to include applications of Information Theory, Machine Learning, and Mathematical Modeling. For my master's thesis, I investigated novel modeling approaches to make improvements in wavelength calibration methods for the Veloce Spectrograph at the Anglo-Australian Telescope.

Beyond academia, my coding journey began with mentorship from my mother, a lead systems analyst. I’ve placed top in hackathons, tackled Kaggle challenges, and competed in chess (peak 1850 Lichess Elo). I also enjoy board games, strength training (530 lb deadlift PR), gravel biking, camping and organizing community events to keep life fun and balanced!
