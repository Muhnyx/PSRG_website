I am a PhD student in the Photonic Subsystems Research Group (PSRG) at Michigan State University, advised by Dr. Thomas Clark. My research focuses on photonic integrated circuits (PICs), microwave photonics, and high-frequency systems for wireless and mmWave communication.

I completed my M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech (2022–2024), after transferring from Purdue University to pursue stronger research alignment. I also hold a B.Tech in Electrical Engineering from NIT Durgapur, India. My academic work spans reconfigurable reflectarrays, graphene-based metalenses, Fabry-Perot cavity simulations, RFIC design and Machine learning and Applications.

Professionally, I have experience from both academia and industry. I worked as a Junior Research Fellow at IIT Roorkee on mmWave slotted antenna arrays, and as a Graduate Research and Teaching Assistant at Virginia Tech. At TATA Metaliks, I developed breaker failure prediction models, conducted association rule mining for system diagnostics, and contributed to IoT integration for power system maintenance.
